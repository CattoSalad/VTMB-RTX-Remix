This Repo is focused on documenting and capturing all information regarding RTX Remix and how to use it with Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines.

### What do I need to know about the game?
Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines is a cult classic RPG game developed by Troika Games released in 2004. It's set in the World of Darkness, a fictional universe created for the tabletop role-playing games, where players take on the roles of vampires. The game is known and loved for its complex narrative, deep character development, and the unique setting that blends gothic horror with modern elements.

The game was originally a flop and had many bugs. A mod has been created and is maintained by [Wesp5](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patch) that aims to fix most bugs and allow the game to run on modern hardware. Known as the **Unofficial Patch**. Additionally a **Plus Patch** can be installed, it comes bundled in the same installer.

* **Unofficial Patch** delivers the experience the developers intended, being the vanilla option to play the game how it was released (with only bug fixes).
* **Plus Patch** aims to restore and even reimagine some cut content, straying a bit from the vanilla experience.

### The Engine
The game runs on the original **Source engine**. It does have some quirks that make it slightly different to how Valve utilised it for Half-Life 2. It also lacks some functionality included in other games with the same engine.
